# Higher Order Kernel Mean Embeddings for Stochastic Processes

## Dependencies

Python libraries required to run the code can be installed by `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

## Structure of the repository

- The `src` folder contains the implementation of the higher order MMDs (sigkernel.py) and higher order distribution regression algorithms (KES.py)
- The `examples` folder contains notebooks to perform two-sample tests, higher order distribution regression and causal graph discovery for stochastic processes
- The `n_vcn_utils` folder contains various utilies for the multibody interaction experiment (adapted from https://github.com/pairlab/v-cdn)
- The `option_utils` folder contains various utilies for the optimal stopping time experiment (adapted from https://github.com/HeKrRuTe/OptStopRandNN)
